# hello-python — Sam H

Small beginner Python project created while learning AI Engineering.

This repository contains a tiny Python script (`main.py`) that prints a friendly greeting.
It is intended to show a simple working example for beginners and for sharing on my GitHub profile.

## How to run 
 `python main.py`
